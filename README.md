The original Orange Bot refills its juice 6AM and 6PM EST every day.
Replace 'Your Token' in Line 48 of the Python File with your Bot Token.

Use .refillcode to send a refill code to your Python Console.

This can be used to refill juices, for example:
You can use '.refill (your refill code; e.g. 42069)' to refill Maximum 20 cups.

You may not distribute the code anywhere else, or make money from it. This is my, juicyguyzer (a.k.a. Ian Park)'s work.

This bot is open-source.
